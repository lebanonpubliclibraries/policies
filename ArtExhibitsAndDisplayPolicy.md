# Art Exhibits and Display Policy #
All displays and exhibits in the libraries must be approved by the Art Display and Exhibits committee with the exception of displays created by library staff to promote library resources. The committee is comprised of community members, at least one member of the board of trustees and a member of the library staff. People who wish to display their art or other work should submit electronic samples for review. Once approved, a committee member will contact the artist with the [Kilton Public Library Exhibitorâ€™s Contract](https://lebanonpubliclibraries.github.io/Policies/KiltonExhibitorsContract). The committee will also be consulted regarding work to be displayed at the Lebanon Library, should the need present itself.

Approved by the Board of Trustees: 5/24/2016
