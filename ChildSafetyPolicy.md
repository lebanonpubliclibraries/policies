The Lebanon Public Libraries are dedicated to providing a welcoming environment that encourages children to visit the Library, attend programs, and use the Library collection and computers.Library staff are available to assist and support children in using the Library and its materials. For the purposes of this policy, children are defined as being under the age of 13.

Library staff are not responsible for children who are left unattended at the library premises. Children under the age of 8 should 
be accompanied and supervised by a parent/guardian/caregiver. Library staff cannot provide child care, supervise unattended children, or assume responsibility for the actions and safety of children.

Parents/guardians/caregivers are responsible for the safety and behavior of their children.

Like all Library users, children are expected to behave appropriately and abide by the Libraryâ€™s Rules and Regulations. Disruptive children who violate the Rules and Regulations may be asked to leave the Library premises. Library staff reserves the right to contact parents or the Lebanon Police Department if an unattended child is being disruptive or is in distress.

Closing Time

It is the responsibility of parents/guardians/caregivers to make sure their children have transportation to and from the library. When an unattended child is left at the library at closing time without transportation, Library staff will make every effort to contact the parents/guardians/caregivers of the child. If no one can be found, Library staff will contact the Lebanon Police Department.
