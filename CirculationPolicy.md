# LEBANON PUBLIC LIBRARIES CIRCULATION POLICY #
## PURPOSE: ##
The purpose of this document is to explain the policies under which items from the collection of the Lebanon Public Libraries are 
circulated.

All library cardholders will be treated equally regarding access to library materials. No restrictions will be imposed based on the type of card held by the patron (teacher, student, etc.)

## WHO MAY BORROW MATERIALS: ##
Any resident of the City of Lebanon may obtain a free library card upon proof of street address. Proof of address may be in the form of a valid driver’s license, received and USPO-cancelled mail, rent receipts, utility bills, tax receipts, or any such items showing the applicant’s name and street address. This includes patrons living at shelters including WISE or Headrest. Ownership of property in the City of Lebanon will qualify a person to receive a free library card. Any current City of Lebanon employee will be issued a free card regardless of place of residency. Individuals may obtain a free library card at the Library Director’s discretion in special circumstances, despite not meeting the criteria listed in this policy.

### PROVISIONAL CARDS: ###
In the interest of good customer service, new patrons who do not have proof of residency will be given a card and asked to provide proof of residency at their next library visit. Staff creating the library card will use the provisional card category which will automatically expire one month from the date the card is created. When proof of residency is produced, staff simply need to change the patron category to “adult resident” or other applicable category.

### Additions: ###
Any staff member or student in the Lebanon public schools will be issued a free card regardless of place of residency.  

Any Lebanon business or non-profit agency will be issued a card in the name of the owner or CEO. The owner or CEO is responsible for all items borrowed. The card must be presented when borrowing.

Any student enrolled in a college located in Lebanon may receive borrowing privileges at the Lebanon Public Libraries.

### NON-RESIDENT CARDS: ###
Any person not meeting the conditions above may obtain a library card upon the completion of registration. The non-resident fee is $75.00 per year per family. A six-month card may be issued at a cost of $40.00. Senior citizens may obtain their cards for $60.00 per year or $35.00 per 6 months. Senior residents of Hartford, VT (age 60 and over) and residents with a child in fifth grade or under may get a non-resident card for their household for $20.00 annually.

## LOST OR DAMAGED ITEMS: ##
A patron who loses an item or returns library material that cannot be easily repaired or cleaned must pay the replacement charge listed in the borrowed item’s record or purchase a replacement copy. The replacement copy must be a new copy of the title and be the exact edition that was damaged or lost. In extenuating circumstances, the library director may authorize the acceptance of another edition. For damaged items, once paid for or replaced, the library customer may keep the damaged item. If a patron finds an item within 30 days of paying for it, the library will refund the payment.

For items with no price in the record, the following costs will be assessed:
* Magazines $3.50
* Mass Market Paperbacks $5.00
* Hardcover and non-Mass Market Paperbacks $20.00
* Music CDs, DVDs, Videocassettes, Audiobooks, Kits $25.00

## OVERDUE MATERIALS: ##
Patrons returning items after their due date will not be charged an overdue fine.

Patrons will be restricted from checking out materials if they have materials which are overdue by more than 14 days. Patrons are encouraged to renew items they wish to keep longer than the original check out period.

## CLAIMS RETURNED: ##
When a patron has an item on their record, but they claim to have returned the item, every effort will be made to search for the item. If the item can not be located to check in, staff should remove it from the patron's record and then change the item status to missing. Any restrictions associated with this item should be removed from the patron's account.

A patron may not return an item that has been removed from the system. They will need to pay for the item as they would if it was lost. The item will be on their record in the note field until paid. The patron is welcome to keep the item.

## LOAN PERIOD: ##
Books, audio books, games, puzzles, and items from our Cool Stuff collection circulate for 3 weeks. DVDs, magazines, and music circulate for 2 weeks. These items may be renewed (if no holds have been placed on them) twice more. The telescope circulates for 7 days and may be renewed once. Museum passes circulate for 3 days. All other items may be renewed (if no ‘holds’ have been placed on them) twice more. Interlibrary loan items are determined by the sending library.

Some items must be used only at the library. Reference, local history, and any library equipment must all be used in house. Library staff may allow exceptions to this rule with the approval of the Reference Librarian for reference materials in the adult collection, or a Children’s Librarian for materials in the children’s collection.
